## Homework 1 assignment
### What 
Choose a domain/topic for your homework. Create a conceptual model of that domain using UML Class Diagrams and a structured textual description (see e.g. this [data specification](https://ofn.gov.cz/%C3%BA%C5%99edn%C3%AD-desky/2021-07-20/)) of what is represented in the domain model. The consecutive homework parts will then be governed by this conceptual model. Quantitative requirements:
5 to 8 classes
Each class 2 to 4 attributes, some with multiplicity `0..*`. Attributes inherited from a parent class in an inheritance hierarchy count as well, i.e. it is ok not to create attributes for a child class if parent class already has 2 to 4.
At least 4 associations. Include association end multiplicities `0..*`, `0..1`, `1..1`.
### How 
Use a tool that allows you to draw UML Class Diagrams and export them, ideally as SVG, PNG if SVG not possible. For example, [diagrams.net](https://www.diagrams.net/), [PlantUML](https://plantuml.com/) or [LucidChart](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/). Beware that the free version of LucidChart does not support "copy as new" functionality. The homework is to be turned in via the study system by a group leader.
