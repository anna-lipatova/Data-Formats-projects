## Homework 1 assignment
### What 
Choose a domain/topic for your homework. Create a conceptual model of that domain using UML Class Diagrams and a structured textual description (see e.g. this [data specification](https://ofn.gov.cz/%C3%BA%C5%99edn%C3%AD-desky/2021-07-20/)) of what is represented in the domain model. The consecutive homework parts will then be governed by this conceptual model. Quantitative requirements:
1. 5 to 8 classes
2. Each class 2 to 4 attributes, some with multiplicity `0..*`. Attributes inherited from a parent class in an inheritance hierarchy count as well, i.e. it is ok not to create attributes for a child class if parent class already has 2 to 4.
3. At least 4 associations. Include association end multiplicities `0..*`, `0..1`, `1..1`.
### How 
Use a tool that allows you to draw UML Class Diagrams and export them, ideally as SVG, PNG if SVG not possible. For example, [diagrams.net](https://www.diagrams.net/), [PlantUML](https://plantuml.com/) or [LucidChart](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/). Beware that the free version of LucidChart does not support "copy as new" functionality. The homework is to be turned in via the study system by a group leader.

## Homework 2 assignment
### What 
Create data samples and queries using graph data models and query languages.
1. For representation of data in RDF, you will need to cover the conceptual model with classes and properties either from [existing vocabularies](https://lov.linkeddata.es/dataset/lov/), or by defining new ones using [RDF Schema](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1SwDgvaTJvUBY_5_EOG3V_ajJsIZadzFNNnJgYqa1Qcw/edit#slide=id.gba51ba2639_1_671). For the newly defined classes and properties use the `@prefix ex: <http://example.org/vocabulary/> .` prefix and attach a human readable label to each one of them. For new properties specify domain and range.
2. Represent the data in RDF using [RDF Turtle](https://www.w3.org/TR/turtle/) and validate. Each RDF resource will have a type.
3. Load the RDF data into a triplestore such as [Apache Jena Fuseki](https://jena.apache.org/documentation/fuseki2/) or [Openlink Virtuoso Open-Source](http://vos.openlinksw.com/owiki/wiki/VOS/VOSDownload) (or both). There is a [triplestore quick-start](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Me_9PDk9HlSFSry2bC_XamVQpheNpJRsqI5PhhrQXhw) slide deck prepared. Openlink Virtuoso also allows you to browse the data in their Faceted search plugin.
4. Using SPARQL, develop a few meaningful executable queries on top of your data, including a comment explaining what each query does.
5. Represent the data in LPG using an executable Cypher script. The data should match the data in RDF as to quantity and meaning. It might differ in the usage of edge properties, which are not present in RDF.
6. Load the LPG data into [Neo4j](https://neo4j.com/download/).
7. Using Cypher, develop a few meaningful queries on top of your data, including a comment explaining what each query does.
### Quantitative requirements 
1. At least 3 instances of each class. In case of inheritance hierarchies, one of each children is enough.
2. Every attribute used at least once.
3. At least 3 instances of each association.
4. At least 4 non-trivial SPARQL queries.
5. At least 4 non-trivial Cypher queries.
